# Recipe-to-Instacart AI Agent - TODO List

## Phase 1: Basic Recipe Parsing (Start Here)
- [ ] Create a simple Python script that can extract ingredients from recipe text
- [ ] Use OpenAI API to parse common recipe formats
- [ ] Extract ingredient names and quantities
- [ ] Test with a few sample recipes

## Phase 2: Ingredient Mapping
- [ ] Create a mapping file for common ingredients to Instacart product names
- [ ] Build a simple matching algorithm
- [ ] Handle quantity conversions (cups to oz, etc.)
- [ ] Test ingredient mapping accuracy

## Phase 3: Basic Instacart Integration
- [ ] Research Instacart API documentation
- [ ] Set up API authentication
- [ ] Create simple function to search for products
- [ ] Test adding one item to cart

## Phase 4: Simple Web Interface
- [ ] Create a basic HTML form to input recipe text
- [ ] Add a simple backend to handle the form
- [ ] Display parsed ingredients and mapped products
- [ ] Allow manual adjustments before ordering

## Phase 5: Order Placement
- [ ] Implement full cart creation
- [ ] Add checkout functionality
- [ ] Handle order confirmation
- [ ] Add error handling

## Phase 6: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Improve ingredient parsing accuracy
- [ ] Add more ingredient mappings
- [ ] Test with various recipe formats
- [ ] Add user feedback and improvements

## Current Focus: Phase 1 - Basic Recipe Parsing

**Next Steps:**
1. Create a simple Python script
2. Set up OpenAI API key
3. Write basic recipe parsing logic
4. Test with sample recipes

**Files to create:**
- `recipe_parser.py` - Main parsing script
- `sample_recipes.txt` - Test recipes
- `.env` - API keys
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
